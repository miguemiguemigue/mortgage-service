# Mortgage Service API

## Description

The Mortgage Service API provides endpoints to fetch the current mortgage interest rates and to perform a mortgage feasibility check. The service calculates the feasibility and monthly costs of a mortgage based on specified business rules.

Key functionalities include:
* Retrieving the list of current mortgage rates.
* Checking if a mortgage is feasible based on the user's financial data.
* The application starts with predefined mortgage interest rates loaded into memory.
* An in-memory H2 database is used for persistence in tests.

## Business Rules
### Given requirements
1. A mortgage cannot exceed 4 times the applicant's income.
2. A mortgage cannot exceed the home value.

The feasibility check adheres to these rules and calculates monthly costs based on the interest rate and loan maturity period.

### Implementation decisions
I tried to stick to the requirements, based on expected functionality and expected development time. Based on that, I decided:
* System will store only one Mortgage Rate for each maturity period.
  * Maturity period is an unique field in mortgage_rates database table
* When checking a mortgage feasibility, a mortgage rate for a given maturity period must exist in the system.

## Main Features
* **Spring Boot 3**
* **Java 17**
* **JPA/Hibernate and H2**
* **Flyway** for managing database migrations
* **Hexagonal architecture**
* **Testing**
  * Unit tests
  * Integration tests using the H2 database to validate API functionality
* **OpenAPI** integration for endpoint documentation
* **In-memory initialization** of mortgage rates at startup

### Framework decisions
1. H2 in-memory relational database
* Requirements expected the mortgage rates to be created in-memory on application startup.
* Mortgage rate structure is mostly fixed, not expecting a wide variety of different interest rates to manage.

2. Flyway
* Flyway is responsible of managing database versioning. Even for an MVP, database evolution should be controlled. 

## Improvements suggestions

While I tried to stick to the requirements, I wanted to define some improvements I was tempted to implement.

### Business Logic
* Add mortgage rates start and end dates
  * Handle dates collision with a priority field, being top priority the smallest one
* Allow mortgage feasibility check as a calculator, without needing a related mortgage rate in the system
  * Add interest rate param to the /mortgage-check endpoint, to allow calculation of mortgage monthly cost, even without having a related mortgage rate in the system.

### Technical improvements
* Change in-memory database for PostgreSQL as a production-ready solution
  * Use TestContainers for integration tests

## Default Mortgage Rates

On application startup, the following mortgage rates are initialized in memory by default. These rates are configured with different `maturityPeriod` values and their corresponding `interestRate`, along with a `lastUpdate` timestamp.

| Maturity Period (Years) | Interest Rate (%) | Last Update                |
|-------------------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| 5                       | 3.0               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |
| 10                      | 3.5               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |
| 15                      | 4.0               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |
| 20                      | 4.5               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |
| 25                      | 5.0               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |
| 30                      | 5.5               | 2024-11-07T14:56:38.469    |

These rates can be accessed through the `/api/interest-rates` endpoint. This setup allows for quick testing and verification of mortgage calculations with a variety of `maturityPeriod` and `interestRate` combinations.

## Requirements

- JDK 17
- Maven 3.8.X
